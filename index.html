          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Our project explores how a machine learning model can detect whether someone is smiling or not using real-time webcam data.
            Built with Google's <strong>Teachable Machine</strong>, the model distinguishes between "Smile" and "Neutral" facial expressions.
            Inspired by <em>Unmasking AI</em> by Joy Buolamwini, our goal is not only technical but also ethical — examining how bias, lighting,
            and facial diversity affect how well AI systems "see" us. This site contains the model, our reflections, and thoughts on AI fairness.

            My name is <strong>Ruike Lin</strong>, and I'm a senior in <strong>Information Science</strong>.
            I enjoy <em>exercising</em> and <em>sleeping in the gym</em> during my free time. I chose this course because it fulfills a major requirement,
            and I was especially excited about the second half of the class focused on <strong>web design</strong> and building digital tools.

            My name is <strong>Yunning Zhang</strong>, and I’m currently a <strong>senior majoring in Information Science</strong>.
            I took this class because I care about how technology shapes society. I’m particularly interested in discussions about <strong>bias, discrimination, and intersectionality</strong>,
            especially when they intersect with the tech industry and emerging technologies like AI.

  <h2><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Our Approach</h2>
  <p>
    We trained our model using Google's Teachable Machine platform, carefully collecting diverse examples of smiling and neutral faces.
    Our process included:
  </p>
  <ul class="approach-list">
    <li>Collecting image samples across different lighting conditions</li>
    <li>Testing with users of different backgrounds</li>
    <li>Evaluating for potential biases in recognition accuracy</li>
    <li>Refining the model through multiple iterations</li>
  </ul>
